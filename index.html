<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div><span><em/></span>entangle! implements federated timelines. It allows you to describe events in your life and arrange them in different, named timelines. </div>
<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>By default, timelines are private. However, you can mark events as public. Timelines with public events show these events to anonymous visitors. </div>
<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>You can merge timelines in an entangle! view. Events are shown on their respective timelines and are sorted chronologically. </div>
<div><br clear="none"/></div>

<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>Events have a start date and either an end date or a duration, specified in days, months or years. Events that last longer than a single day have their start and end dates on the timeline. Both dates are graphically connected by a bracket spanning from start to end. </div>
<div><br clear="none"/></div>

<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>Dates can be specified precisely or by giving only year and month or year alone. Events can be marked as <em>anniversary</em>. In this case, the yearly events are included on the timeline and can be formatted to show the ordinal number, e.g. event "Tim's Birth" and anniversaries "Tim's 2nd Birthday".</div>

<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>Events are associated with <em>locations</em>, named entities with longitute and latitude. Locations are shown in parentheses after an event title on the timelines. <br clear="none"/>
		<div><br clear="none"/></div>
		<div>Events can be marked as <em>public</em>. Public events are listed on the syndication page for a particular user. A first version of entanglement is implemented by the capability to replicate timelines with public events into a user's own set of timelines. More elaborate forms of syndication are planned.</div>

		<div>entangle! is also open source software. You are encouraged to try tthe PHAR archive or install it from the Github repository (https://github.com/oschettler/entangle) and run it on your own server. It is implemented in PHP5 and needs an SQlite database to run. </div>
